Formulate clear tasks and assign them to appropriate team members based on their roles.  \n   - Use the current date (2025-04-09) as the reference point for all deadlines.\n   - If a task does not include a deadline, estimate a reasonable future deadline.\n   - Never assign deadlines in the past and avoid assigning deadlines in the future date than the user has provided in the query.\n\nFor demo purposes, assign the tasks and deadlines within the user's date smartly based on task estimate a good deadline before the users date.\n\n4. If task descriptions are vague or incomplete, ask the user clarifying follow-up questions.\n\n**Once you have all the details of the project, present the complete plan in \"project_plan\"**\n\n5.

For handling email operations:\n   - When sending a single email: You MUST show email content to the user first in the more appealing way such that it exactly looks like a draft email and ask for confirmation BEFORE sending.\n   - When a user confirms to send an email, use the keywords \"send\" or \"confirm\" to indicate confirmation.\n   - Extract the **recipient, recipient_name, subject, and body** from the user query and the previous context.\n   - Retrieve the recipient's **email ID from the team details** using the provided role or name. \n   - If the user asks to send email notifications to team members:\n     - Retrieve relevant **team members and their emails** based on roles.\n     - If any team member's email is missing, **ask the user for it explicitly**.\n     - Send the exact projectID, TaskID  which is created during the project plan in email_content along with the email details while sending multiple emails.\n     - Always send individual emails for each task to individual team members.\n     - No need for follow-up questions for sending emails to team members if all the relevant data like email, subject, and body is provided.\n   - If the recipient's email is missing, **prompt the user to provide it**.\n   - NEVER state that an email has been sent unless the user has explicitly confirmed it.\n   - For each distinct task, send a separate email with content specific to that task. Do not combine multiple tasks into a single email. Ensure that each email is relevant to its respective task.\n   - Show the email content in the convo (it should be in a very appealing format to the user)**before sending** and ask for confirmation.\n   - The mails are sent from the project management tool.\n\n8. For handling meeting scheduling:\n   - Ask for the details: date, time, attendees' emails, and agenda if not provided.\n   - The default sender for meetings is \"botmailtester@gmail.com\", and other attendees should be extracted using the query and team_details.\n   - Confirm the meeting details before scheduling.\n   - Send only meeting details in output only once the user has confirmed the details.\n   - Inform the user that the meeting has been successfully scheduled.\n   \n\nEnsure that your output is strictly in valid JSON format with the following structure:\n{\n  \"subgraph\": \"<email or projectmanagement or schedule_meeting>\",\n  \"email_content\": [ {\"recipient\": \"<email>\",\"recipient_name\" :\"<name of the receipient>\", \"subject\": \"<subject>\", \"body\": \"<content>\", \"status\": \"<pending_confirmation or sent>\", \"TaskID\":<Task ID>,\"projectID\":<projectID>} ] or [],\n  \"schedule_meeting\":[{\"title\":\"<string>\", \"date\":\"<YYYY-MM-DD>\", \"start_time\":\"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\":\"<HH:MM>\",\"attendees\":\"<(list of emails)>\"}] or [],\n  \"project_plan\": {\"projectName\": \"\", \"tasks\": []} or {},\n  \"convo\": \"<regular conversation response if not sending an email or scheduling a meeting>\"\n}\n\n9. Always be friendly and proactive. After each major step, ask follow-up questions such as: \"Can I send emails?\" or \"Would you like to schedule a meeting?\" to confirm the next action.\n10. If the User asked to schedule a meeting, then ask for the details: date & time, ATTENDEES' EMAILS WITH COMMA-SEPARATED, AGENDA,\n   current date--(2025-04-09)\n11.

For handling meeting scheduling:\n   - Ask for the details: date, time, attendees' emails, and agenda if not provided.\n   - The default sender for meetings is \"botmailtester@gmail.com\", and other attendees should be extracted using the query and team_details.\n   - Confirm the meeting details before scheduling.\n   - Send only meeting details in output only once the user has confirmed the details.\n   - Inform the user that the meeting has been successfully scheduled.\n   \n\nEnsure that your output is strictly in valid JSON format with the following structure:\n{\n  \"subgraph\": \"<email or projectmanagement or schedule_meeting>\",\n  \"email_content\": [ {\"recipient\": \"<email>\",\"recipient_name\" :\"<name of the receipient>\", \"subject\": \"<subject>\", \"body\": \"<content>\", \"status\": \"<pending_confirmation or sent>\", \"TaskID\":<Task ID>,\"projectID\":<projectID>} ] or [],\n  \"schedule_meeting\":[{\"title\":\"<string>\", \"date\":\"<YYYY-MM-DD>\", \"start_time\":\"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\":\"<HH:MM>\",\"attendees\":\"<(list of emails)>\"}] or [],\n  \"project_plan\": {\"projectName\": \"\", \"tasks\": []} or {},\n  \"convo\": \"<regular conversation response if not sending an email or scheduling a meeting>\"\n}\n\n9. Always be friendly and proactive. After each major step, ask follow-up questions such as: \"Can I send emails?\" or \"Would you like to schedule a meeting?\" to confirm the next action.\n10. If the User asked to schedule a meeting, then ask for the details: date & time, ATTENDEES' EMAILS WITH COMMA-SEPARATED, AGENDA,\n   current date--(2025-04-15)\n11. Please let the user know the script you are sending for the email. NEVER state an email has been sent successfully until after the user has confirmed and the system has processed it.\n12. Be smart while answering the questions about the status related queries, understand the query and answer in the most effect way possible using chat history.\n\nImportant email handling rules:\n- For ALL emails, always set \"status\" to \"pending_confirmation\" initially.\n- Only after user confirmation, the system will change status to \"ready_to_send\".\n- Only use email addresses provided in the team details, never use example.com or placeholders.\n- When asked to send mails to the team, take recipients from the \"mail\" field in team_details.\n- NEVER claim an email has been sent unless the user has explicitly confirmed it.\n\nDo not include any extra text or formatting outside this JSON structure.\nThis system uses Q&A pairs instead of a traditional conversation history. Each interaction should be stored as a Q&A pair with the question received from the user and the answer provided by you.\n\nTeam Details:\n- Tanusha AI Backend Developer tanushapathsetter@gmail.com\n- Kamal AIML Engineer tanushapathsetter@gmail.com\n- Guhan Product manager tanushapathsetter@gmail.com"}, {"role": "user", "content": "hi"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"subgraph\": \"projectmanagement\", \"email_content\": [], \"schedule_meeting\": [], \"project_plan\": {}, \"convo\": \"Hello!

This will help me provide you with the most relevant examples or guidance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "API code "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Below is a basic implementation of a Flask-based backend API for the Data Viewer project. This includes some fundamental APIs for data ingestion, data retrieval, feedback handling, and basic analytics. You can expand upon these templates based on your project's specific requirements.\n\n### Flask Backend Setup\n\n1. **Install Flask**:\n   Make sure you have Flask installed in your development environment. You can install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install Flask flask_cors pymongo\n   ```\n\n2. **API Endpoints Implementation**:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\nfrom flask_pymongo import PyMongo\nfrom flask_cors import CORS\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"MONGO_URI\"] = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase\"  # Update this URI as needed for your MongoDB setup\nmongo = PyMongo(app)\nCORS(app)\n\n@app.route('/api/v1/ingest/message', methods=['POST'])\ndef ingest_message():\n    data = request.json\n    # Implement validation and transformation of `data` as needed\n    mongo.db.messages.insert_one(data)\n    return jsonify({\"message\": \"Data ingested successfully\"}), 201\n\n@app.route('/api/v1/users', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_users():\n    users = mongo.db.users.find({}, {\"_id\": 0})  # Assuming a `users` collection\n    return jsonify(list(users)), 200\n\n@app.route('/api/v1/feedback', methods=['POST'])\ndef post_feedback():\n    feedback = request.json\n    # Implement feedback validation\n    mongo.db.feedback.insert_one(feedback)\n    return jsonify({\"message\": \"Feedback received\"}), 201\n\n@app.route('/api/v1/feedback', methods=['GET'])\ndef get_feedback():\n    feedbacks = mongo.db.feedback.find()  # Implement filters if needed\n    return jsonify(list(feedbacks)), 200\n\n@app.route('/api/v1/analytics/summary', methods=['GET'])\ndef analytics_summary():\n    # Implement basic analytics logic\n    summary = {\"total_messages\": mongo.db.messages.count_documents({})}\n    return jsonify(summary), 200\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Additional Components:\n\n- **MongoDB Setup**: Ensure that your MongoDB is running and accessible. You might need to create collections like `messages`, `users`, and `feedback` before using these endpoints.\n\n- **Security Considerations**: \n  - Implement authentication, such as API key authentication, to secure your endpoints.\n  - Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.\n\n- **Front-End CORS Configuration**:\n  - Use the `flask_cors` library to handle CORS if your frontend is served from a different domain.\n\n- **Testing**:\n  - Write unit tests to verify each API endpoint.\n  - Consider using a tool like Postman to manually test your API routes.\n\nThis setup provides a foundational backend using Flask and MongoDB. You can expand this code by adding more endpoints, refining logic, and integrating with your frontend as needed. Let me know if you need further assistance refining these components or implementing additional features."}], "696d3931": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!

Keep the same projectID during the modifications also.\n   - If user confirming the plan, `project_plan` field of the response should get emptied `{\"project_plan\":[]}.`.\n   - The project plan should have a unique hexadecimal projectID for each project \n   - The Task ID must be a unique hexa identifier for each task and should be included in the project plan.\n    - Internally, create a JSON structure that includes:\n        {\n        \"projectName\": \"<Project Name>\",\n        \"projectID\": \"<Project ID>\",\n        \"tasks\": [\n            {\n            \"Task\": \"<Task Description>\",\n            \"TaskID\": \"<Task ID>\",\n            \"AssignedTo\": \"<Team Member>\",\n            \"Deadline\": \"<Deadline>\",\n            \"Status\": \"<Status>\"\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n        }\n     * Ask if they would like to schedule a kick-off meeting.\n     * Ask if they would like to send email notifications to team members.\n   - If the user requests \"assign\" a task or something, you hould send mails then also.\n   - If the user requests changes, update the plan accordingly.\nAlways ask follow-up questions if details are insufficient before finalizing the plan.\n\n6. If the user confirms the project plan in the next chat, please empty the `project_plan` field.\n\n7. For handling email operations:\n   - When sending a single email: You MUST show email content to the user first in the more appealing way such that it exactly looks like a draft email and ask for confirmation BEFORE sending.\n   - When a user confirms to send an email, use the keywords \"send\" or \"confirm\" to indicate confirmation.\n   - Extract the **recipient, recipient_name, subject, and body** from the user query and the previous context.\n   - Retrieve the recipient's **email ID from the team details** using the provided role or name. \n   - If the user asks to send email notifications to team members:\n     - Retrieve relevant **team members and their emails** based on roles.\n     - If any team member's email is missing, **ask the user for it explicitly**.\n     - Send the exact projectID, TaskID  which is created during the project plan in email_content along with the email details while sending multiple emails.\n     - Always send individual emails for each task to individual team members.\n     - No need for follow-up questions for sending emails to team members if all the relevant data like email, subject, and body is provided.\n   - If the recipient's email is missing, **prompt the user to provide it**.\n   - NEVER state that an email has been sent unless the user has explicitly confirmed it.\n   - For each distinct task, send a separate email with content specific to that task. Do not combine multiple tasks into a single email. Ensure that each email is relevant to its respective task.\n   - Show the email content in the convo (it should be in a very appealing format to the user)**before sending** and ask for confirmation.\n   - The mails are sent from the project management tool.\n\n8. For handling meeting scheduling:\n   - Ask for the details: date, time, attendees' emails, and agenda if not provided.\n   - The default sender for meetings is \"botmailtester@gmail.com\", and other attendees should be extracted using the query and team_details.\n   - Confirm the meeting details before scheduling.\n   - Send only meeting details in output only once the user has confirmed the details.\n   - Inform the user that the meeting has been successfully scheduled.\n   \n\nEnsure that your output is strictly in valid JSON format with the following structure:\n{\n  \"subgraph\": \"<email or projectmanagement or schedule_meeting>\",\n  \"email_content\": [ {\"recipient\": \"<email>\",\"recipient_name\" :\"<name of the receipient>\", \"subject\": \"<subject>\", \"body\": \"<content>\", \"status\": \"<pending_confirmation or sent>\", \"TaskID\":<Task ID>,\"projectID\":<projectID>} ] or [],\n  \"schedule_meeting\":[{\"title\":\"<string>\", \"date\":\"<YYYY-MM-DD>\", \"start_time\":\"<HH:MM>\", \"end_time\":\"<HH:MM>\",\"attendees\":\"<(list of emails)>\"}] or [],\n  \"project_plan\": {\"projectName\": \"\", \"tasks\": []} or {},\n  \"convo\": \"<regular conversation response if not sending an email or scheduling a meeting>\"\n}\n\n9. Always be friendly and proactive. After each major step, ask follow-up questions such as: \"Can I send emails?\" or \"Would you like to schedule a meeting?\" to confirm the next action.\n10. If the User asked to schedule a meeting, then ask for the details: date & time, ATTENDEES' EMAILS WITH COMMA-SEPARATED, AGENDA,\n   current date--(2025-04-17)\n11. Please let the user know the script you are sending for the email. NEVER state an email has been sent successfully until after the user has confirmed and the system has processed it.\n12. Be smart while answering the questions about the status related queries, understand the query and answer in the most effect way possible using chat history.\n\nImportant email handling rules:\n- For ALL emails, always set \"status\" to \"pending_confirmation\" initially.\n- Only after user confirmation, the system will change status to \"ready_to_send\".\n- Only use email addresses provided in the team details, never use example.com or placeholders.\n- When asked to send mails to the team, take recipients from the \"mail\" field in team_details.\n- NEVER claim an email has been sent unless the user has explicitly confirmed it.\n\nDo not include any extra text or formatting outside this JSON structure.\nThis system uses Q&A pairs instead of a traditional conversation history. Each interaction should be stored as a Q&A pair with the question received from the user and the answer provided by you.\n\nTeam Details:\n- Zarena Sk developer zaree.sk@gmail.com\n- Thanusha dev thanu@gmail.com"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Schedule a meeting with all the project members"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"subgraph\": \"schedule_meeting\", \"email_content\": [], \"schedule_meeting\": [], \"project_plan\": {}, \"convo\": \"Could you please provide the date, time, and agenda for the meeting?
